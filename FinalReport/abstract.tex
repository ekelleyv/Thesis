This paper proposes a system for capturing 3D imagery of large objects using autonomous quadcopters. A major component of such a system is accurately localizing the position and orientation of the quadcopter in order to perform precise movements. This paper focuses on the design and implementation of a localization algorithm that uses a particle filter to combine internal sensor measurements and detected augmented reality tags in order to estimate the position and orientation of an AR.Drone quadcopter. This system is shown to perform significantly better than integrated velocity measurements alone.
