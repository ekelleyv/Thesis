\section{Quadcopters for Model Acquisition}

The past decade has seen a huge increase in the use of quadcopters for a variety of applications. With the improvement of stabilization software, quadcopters have seen a rise in popularity as a stable, cheap, and highly maneuverable aerial platform. 

Although a relatively new field, several research groups have studied the use of quadcopters in 3D model construction. Irschara et al. created a system to generate 3D models using images taken from UAVs. While a quadcopter was used for gathering imagery, the quadcopter was manually controlled and the main focus of their work was photogrammetry-based model creation \cite{Irschara}. Steffen et al. studied surface reconstruction using aerial photography captured by UAVs \cite{Steffen}.

Most relevant to our work, Engel et al. published multiple papers on the camera-based navigation and localization of the AR.Drone. While they were able to acheive very accurate navigation, their work relies on the drone facing a mostly planar surface during the entire flight, a constraint that is not possible in our application.
